## Project Information

Airbnbeezy is a clone of https://www.airbnb.com. Users can use this site to book visits to other users' properties or list their own properties for bookings, and reviews are available for those who have already finished their stay on someone's property. Users have profiles on which they can pridefully show off their own listings, and which they can customize by uploading a user image and by filling out the 'About' section. All site visitors can browse the site listings or use the search bar to find a specific location.
